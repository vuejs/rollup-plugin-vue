# Cookbook

The Cookbook gives developers examples to work off of that both cover common or interesting use cases, and also progressively explain more complex detail. Our goal is to move beyond a simple introductory example, and demonstrate concepts that are more widely applicable, as well as some caveats to the approach.

## Minimal

rollup-plugin-vue ships as zero config solution to package `.vue` files.
